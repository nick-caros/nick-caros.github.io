I am a fourth year PhD student at the [MIT Transit Lab](transit.mit.edu) and [Urban Mobility Lab](mobility.mit.edu), working with Professor [Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/jinhua-zhao). My research interests are focused on merging optimization methods with travel behavior to prepare transit and land use policy for the future of work. Throughout my PhD I have had academic research partnerships with the MBTA, CTA, WMATA and SFMTA, working to help these agencies solve challenges around bus performance analysis, visualization and strategic planning for remote work. I hold degrees in engineering from UBC and NYU, and have work experience in heavy civil construction, transportation planning consulting and international transportation policy analysis.
