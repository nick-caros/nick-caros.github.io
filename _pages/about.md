I am a 2nd year PhD student at the [MIT Transit Lab](transit.mit.edu) and [Urban Mobility Lab](mobility.mit.edu), working with Professor [Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/jinhua-zhao). My research interests are focused around merging optimization methods with travel behavior to understand and improve public transit, land use and transportation policy. My academic research partnership is with the MBTA, where I work on bus performance analysis and visualization. I hold degrees in engineering from UBC and NYU, and have work experience in heavy civil construction and transportation planning consulting.
